# LinearAlgebraThings

Not really sure what to put here. Plan on adding more things to the repo as time goes on but for now, "VectorThing" is pretty much just a simple matrix addition/multiplication thing. The logic is all there but there's no real interface so you'll have to hard-code things in main to run the different opeartions. Running it in terminal is pretty nice though as you're able to type out the elements in the matrix as they would be written and it (more or less) maintains that integrity with the output matrix.

But as it stands, the program is capable of effectively addding matrices, multiplying them, subtracting them, and scalar multiplication; and the program will tell you if two matrices can't be added/multiplied together.

TODO: Should probably comment my shit in case someone else is trying to figure out what I did in the code.
